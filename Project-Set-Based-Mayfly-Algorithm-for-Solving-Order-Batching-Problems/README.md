This research proposes a novel approach to the order batching problem in a warehouse with the objective of minimizing total tardiness. The tardiness occurs when an order contains multiple items with different locations, requiring careful order batching to optimize picking routes. The proposed method considers category, weight, and fragility constraints for both food and non-food items with varying weights and weight capacities. This problem is challenging due to the complex constraints and requires an efficient solution to minimize total picking tardiness. Therefore, metaheuristic approach is utilized in the work. 
To address this problem, we propose a metaheuristic approach based on the Mayfly Algorithm (MA). The MA is a powerful technique that benefits from the movement and behavior of male and female mayfly populations, including their mating dances and random flights, which help avoid getting stuck in local optima. However, it was originally designed for continuous problems. Therefore, we adapt the MA using a set-based approach to tackle the discrete nature of the order batching problem. The proposed Set-based Mayfly Algorithm (SBMA) aims to minimize the total tardiness while considering the aforementioned constraints.
The SBMA requires parameter tuning to achieve optimal performance. We conducted an extensive experimental study on six problem instances, including small, medium, and large-sized problems. We evaluated the performance of the SBMA and compared it with two other set-based metaheuristics: the Set-based Marine Predator Algorithm (SBMPA) and the Set-based Squirrel Search Algorithm (SBSSA). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SMA in achieving the lowest total tardiness compared to the other methods.
